# Project: Planeshifter
## One Liner
Project: Planeshifter is a 2D Runner game in which the player will have to use the stunning ability to change between planes of reality in order to create paths that allow them to reach the goal in each level.

## Basic Mechanics
As an autorunner, the main character will move on their own, thus, leaving the player with just two mechanics:
- **Jump**: the character can jump and, when used against walls, they can wall-jump and change run direction.
- **Planeshifting**: there are paths that can only be used when they are in the correct plane of reality. The character has the ability to change between the two realms to walk over these paths.

## Dynamics
- The game requires the player to use the basic mechanics with the correct timing to move forward to the level.
- In order to find the path to reach the goal, the player would need to change the direction, colliding with non-letal walls.

## Enemies and Dangers
Reaching the goal won't be a piece of cake. The player must evade triangular enemies and spikes present in the levels while taking care of not falling into the abyss. The player can find two types of enemies in the game:
- **X Enemies**: These enemies can only move themselves horizontally. When thy reach at the end of their paths (at the end of a platform or when they collide with a wall), they turn around and walks in the invert direction.
- **Y Enemies**: These enemies can only move themselves vertically. They have the same logic that the **X Enemies**, but with vertical movement.
These enemies need to be evaded in every ocasion. Confrontation is not an option.

## Art Style
As a minimalist art, the game doesn't have complex visual design. It is componed by simple shapes and colors with different functions:
- **Player**: The player is a yellow circle that stands out agains the background. It is always visible by the player.
- **Enemies**: The enemies are red triangles that also stand out agains the background. They are seeing with enough time to evade them.
- **Platforms**: The platforms are dark-grey rectangles, and they are the only walkable element in all the game.
- **Goal**: The goal is composed by a green platform and a green flag.
- **Background**: The background is composed by a grey scale, so it doesn't distract the player for the obstacles and the goal.
