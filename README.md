# Project: Planeshifter
## One Liner
Project: Planeshifter is a 2D Runner game in which the player will have to use the stunning ability to change between planes of reality in order to create paths that allow them to reach the goal in each level.

## Basic Mechanics
As an autorunner, the main character will move on their own, thus, leaving the player with just two mechanics:
- **Jump**: the character can jump and, when used against walls, they can wall-jump and change run direction.
- **Planeshifting**: there are paths that can only be used when in the correct plane of reality. The character has the ability to change between the two realms to walk over these paths.
